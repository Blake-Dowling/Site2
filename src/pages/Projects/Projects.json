        "description": "Deployed Three.js arcade simulation demonstrating AI algorithms for Tetris, Snake, 1024, and Mario with static frontend model loading and training history visualization. Leveraged OOP Principles of inheritance, overloading, and polymorphism to modularize games, agents, models, and visual components. Designed DQN and genetic algorithm classes using Tensorflow.js and Node.js backend for 100x training speedup and model persistence."

Implemented thread pool design to allow use of a variable number of cores per server. Optimized multicast and TCP interaction to achieve a 2000% speedup from my sequential true radix cracking algorithm, winning first place in an advanced C++ programming competition."

Streamlined data processing using JSON, React component mapping, SASS, and setState callbacks. Deployed a feature-rich front end application with interactive stylesheets, live rendering, pop-up cards, accordions, and carousels."
